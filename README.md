Nashville Dataset: Data Cleaning Project

Overview:

This project demonstrates my skills in handling and transforming raw data to make it suitable for analysis and visualization.

Project Goals:

The primary goals of this project were to clean and preprocess the Nashville dataset, addressing issues such as missing values, inconsistencies, and dataformats... By applying SQL queries and transformations, I aimed to create a refined and standardized dataset ready for further analysis
.
Key Steps:

Data Exploration:Utilized SQL queries to assess the structure, types, and general characteristics of the data.

Handling Missing Values:Identified and assessed missing values in the dataset and employed SQL techniques to handle missing data through imputation, deletionâ€¦

Data Standardization:Ensured consistency in data by standardizing formats, units, and representations.

Data Validation:Conducted validation checks to ensure data accuracy and integrity.

Technologies Used:

SQL

Results:

The cleaned dataset is now available for analysis, offering a solid foundation for insights into the Nashville dataset. The code and documentation provided in this repository serve as a testament to my proficiency in data cleaning using SQL.
